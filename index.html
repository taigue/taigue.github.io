		<h1>PROJECT 1: FL Studio</h1>
		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		<p> What I planned for this project was to use FL Studio to create several music tracks.
		I achieved this to an extent. My finished product was 5 short beats that I was happy with and proud of.</p>
		<h3> OBJECTIVES </h3>
		<p> 1. Learn how to operate the software  2. Produce at least 3 beats by the end of the project
 3. Have a full 3.30-minute track completed </p>
<h3> RESULTS </h3>
<p> 1. I can now use FL Studio at an adept level  2. I made 5 short beats </p>

<h3> PROCESS & PLANNING </h3>
<p> I watched A guide initially to get an idea of how to use the software, 
I followed the first two parts of the series, before I was comfortable using 
FL on my own. Because FL comes with a limited supply of drums, instruments, 
etc, I had to download some to fit the style I was going for. I found I could
 make decent drum loops quite easily  but the challenge was the melodies, I 
 wasn’t making great ones, so I followed tutorials online to improve my ability, 
 I spent a lot, probably the most time out of anything on this, learning how to
 make one on the piano, the best one I developed is used in the second track. On 
 each song I tried to use new, different instruments so I was constantly looking 
 for instruction on each one, most of the time I would end up in the same place; 
 YouTube, following a tutorial from someone with a bad microphone. The process that
 I used for most of these was a simple one, I’d make 3 layers for the melody, the 
 drums, & than anything else, once I got the basic loop id make an intro, usually 
 just the melody accompanied by less drums, add effects to all the sections like 
 reverb, EQ’s, etc & then done. </p>

 <h3> DISCUSSION </h3>
 <p> Overall, I’m satisfied with what I created & achieved. It was mostly a smooth ride,
 however, there were several difficulties during the process. I spent a lot of time trying
 to make a beat using a sample, but I had difficulty matching what I made with the
 clip to make them sound good together, no matter how many different ones I tried to use, it
 wouldn’t work out, eventually I gave up, this was my only entirely scrapped track. I haven’t
 made a full length beat yet, mostly because variation is hard, making a full beat would’ve taken a
 loot longer & been a lot lees impressive in the end. But moving onto the next project I am 
 considering continuing with this. If I do, I'd like to focus on expanding my skill set, making
 full length tracks & giving them a more modern sound. </p>
